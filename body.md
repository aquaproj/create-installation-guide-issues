Hi, thank you for your great project!

We suggest to add the installation guide with aqua to the document.
[aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/) is a declarative CLI Version Manager.
You can install this tool with aqua.

```sh
aqua init # Create aqua.yaml
aqua g -i <package> # Add this tool to aqua.yaml
aqua i # Install tools
```

For the detail of aqua, please see [the official document](https://aquaproj.github.io/).

We expect you can just copy and paste the following guide to your document.
